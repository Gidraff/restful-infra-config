# Restful-infra-config(IaC)
----------------------------------------------
##### Here I show a simple implementation of Infrastructure as Code.

###### Technology used:
* Packer : to build packer images.

* Ansible : A configuration management tool. I have used ansible as a provision for my packer images.

* Docker: Containerization engine. I have used docker to build my docker image to be run by jenkins as a build agent on jenkins build. 

* Terraform: A tool for building, changing  and versioning infrastructure efficiently and safely.
